## Preface
At the beginning, it is necessary to say that this text is adapted from several reference books on the subject of Design Patterns, which we will mention to them at the end of this article, and the author of this article had no influence on its scientific content. I strongly recommend reading the sources.

## Why Design Pattern ?
Object-Oriented software design is a difficult task and reusable design is even more difficult. If you don't know anything about Object-Oriented, reading this article won't help you much, and it can be said that the prerequisite for learning Design patterns is mastering Object-Oriented concepts.
###### What is reusable design?
If you have programmed, you have noticed that at the end of programming, you have been able to give a solution to the problem that was in front of you, and if you have gained this experience many times, you will notice that you have encountered with the same problem domain which you have faced before and you were able to find a solution for it.
Now it may be a duplicate problem domain, but due to the different conditions and situation types, you have not been able to use the same previous solution for this repeated problem and you have had to find a new solution for it. In other words, it can be said that your design is not flexible and reusable, and it has caused you to provide different solutions for repetitive problems, and this is not a good thing. Our design must be reusable, and this is not the only feature of a good design, in fact, other factors such as elegant, flexible, and efficiency are among the other criteria of a good design.

Now, a question arises, how to deal with a new problem domain, taking into account the mentioned criteria, to make a design so that when we face the same problem again in the next work, we can get the desired solution with minimal changes in our previous solution? 

In response, it should be said that this is not an easy task at all and requires a lot of successful experience. It means that it becomes possible with the passage of time. You should record the experiences and results obtained after each design and use previous experiences repeatedly and improve your design skill, which is called Sprint-Retrospective, and finally become an expert object-oriented designer. You definitely don't have that much time to spend on gaining experience so that you can do a design with the mentioned criteria. This is where the issue of Design Pattern comes into play
